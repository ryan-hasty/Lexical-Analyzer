# Lexical-Analyzer
Lexical Analyzer/Tokenizer for .jack program files

This program tokenizes source code from .jack program files based on the syntax rules of the programming language.

This program was assigned in my Principles of Programming Languages class at UCA.
I originally wrote the program in Python, but I wanted Kotlin practice. 
The program in Kotlin is much more readable and writable compared to the python one that I wrote.
